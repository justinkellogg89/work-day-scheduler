# work-day-scheduler

## This repo contains an index.html, a style.css, a script.js, and a README.md file. This repo contains the files and functionality for a work planner for someone working 9am to 5pm. It allows the user to input appointments, or reminders into a text area and save it to local storage so that it will return upon reload.

## Installation

The only software requirements are a web browser.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, Bootstrap.

## Usage

Upon opening the index.html file, the user will see a few rows and columns. The most notable aspect is the coloring scheme. If the row is gray, then the time block has past. If the row is orange, it is the current time slot. If it is green, then the time block is in the future.

THere is a fully functional clock and date display in the heading of the page. The clock is designed to refresh every second so that the time is always up to date.

Each time block has a text area that allows the user to input whatever they wish. Upon entering their text, the user must click the save button to the right. When the save button is clicked, the text value is saved to the local storage of the user's browser. In order to remove text, it must be deleted and saved again.

## Project Status

This project is completed. While there is additional functionality that could be added later, it stands on it's own currently.
